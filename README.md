# Welcome to GoEasyCLI

When you're starting a new Go project, there are a few things you need to do to get the project running. You need to create a new project, set up your project structure, and install the necessary dependencies. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if you're starting a new project from scratch, or if you're not familiar with the Go ecosystem. `GoEasyCLI` is a command-line interface that helps you bootstrap your Go project with ease. It creates a new project for you, sets up the project structure, and installs the necessary dependencies, so you can get started with your project right away.

## Installation

```bash
bash installation script here
```

## Usage

```bash
goeasycli --help
```

## Commands

- `goeasycli -p <project_name> -f {gin, fiber}` - this will create a new project with the framework you choose. If the framework is not specified, it will default to `gin`.
